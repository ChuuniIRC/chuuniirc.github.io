# problems with social media today...?

- your admin owns you(?)
- "haha imagine being able to host it yourself"
- instances shut down
- ppl use multiple social media today, why not improve the experience
- (need more ideas to talk about)

## instances shut down

so many folks have talked about mastodon instances shutting down. folks have
also talked about cohost shutting down.

## your admin owns you(?)

(this is about mastodon, we don't have sources for this one)

mastodon pushes pretty hard the idea that you only need a single mastodon account

doing so, however, puts your admin entirely in control of the friendships you
are allowed to have.

it's unlikely that mastodon would ever be able to handle multiple accounts well,
because multiple accounts goes against one of its design goals (see above).

(this is about bluesky)

sure, if you have 10 TB to spare... and probably a few other issues.
